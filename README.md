What is Pazuzu?
---------------
Pazuzu is a tool that builds Docker images from feature snippets, while
resolving all dependencies between them. One of the common use cases is
Continuous Integration environment, where jobs require specific tooling present
for building and testing. Pazuzu can significantly ease that process, by
letting user choose from a wide selection of predefined Dockerfile snippets
that represent those dependencies (e.g. Golang, Python, Android SDK, customized
NPM installs).
