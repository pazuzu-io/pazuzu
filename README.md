What is Pazuzu?
---------------
Pazuzu is a tool that builds Docker images from feature snippets, while 
resolving all dependencies between them. One of the common use cases is 
Continuous Integration environment, where jobs require specific tooling present 
for building and testing. Pazuzu can significantly ease that process, by letting user 
choose from a wide selection of predefined Dockerfile snippets that represent 
those dependencies (e.g. Golang, Python, Android SDK, customized NPM installs).
